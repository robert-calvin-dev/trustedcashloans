  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>The first six months were about survival. Now it’s about stacking wins. This short-term plan helps you transition from just staying afloat to building wealth, control, and options.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Track Net Worth</h2>
  <p>You’ve been budgeting. Now start tracking your net worth—assets minus debts. Watching it grow month over month builds confidence and direction.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Save 1–2 Months of Expenses</h2>
  <p>Your emergency fund needs backup. Build up to at least 1–2 months of core expenses. That cushion buys freedom—and lowers anxiety.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Double Down on Debt</h2>
  <p>Eliminate toxic debt. Interest is your enemy. Make extra payments aggressively. Consolidate if rates are better. Every $100 you kill is $100 you own.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Build Systems</h2>
  <p>Automate everything—savings, payments, investments. Remove willpower from the equation. Systems > motivation.</p>

  <h2>Step 5: Invest in Earning Power</h2>
  <p>Take a course. Learn a new skill. Update your resume. This is when you start pivoting from survival income to strategic growth.</p>
