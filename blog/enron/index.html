  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Enron went from Wall Street darling to cautionary tale almost overnight. At its peak, it was America’s seventh-largest company. Within months, it was bankrupt, and its name became synonymous with corporate fraud. Here’s how it all unraveled.</p>

  <h2>The Rise</h2>
  <p>Founded in 1985, Enron transformed from a regional energy provider into a global energy trader. Its complex trading business and bold marketing made it a media favorite. But behind the buzz, the numbers didn’t add up.</p>

  <h2>Accounting Gymnastics</h2>
  <p>Enron used "mark-to-market" accounting, booking profits based on future projections—not actual income. They also hid debt in off-balance-sheet entities called Special Purpose Entities (SPEs). It looked like growth. It was debt in disguise.</p>

  <h2>The Players</h2>
  <p>CEO Jeff Skilling and Chairman Ken Lay were the faces of Enron. CFO Andrew Fastow built the shady financial structures. Auditing firm Arthur Andersen turned a blind eye—until it was too late.</p>

  <h2>The Collapse</h2>
  <p>In late 2001, analysts started asking questions. Confidence evaporated. Stock prices plummeted. Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001. Thousands lost jobs, pensions, and life savings.</p>

  <h2>The Fallout</h2>
  <p>Executives went to prison. Arthur Andersen shut down. And the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was born—new federal regulations to prevent future frauds of this scale.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>The Enron lesson?</strong> If the numbers seem too good to be true, they probably are.<br>
