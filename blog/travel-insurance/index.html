  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Travel Insurance?</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Travel insurance sounds like one of those “nice-to-have” extras—until the airline loses your luggage, your passport gets swiped in a street market, or your appendix decides to explode in a foreign country. But the truth? Most people either overpay for junk policies or skip it when they shouldn’t. Let’s cut the fluff and make it simple.</p>

  <h2>When It’s Probably Worth It</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You’re leaving the country and your regular health insurance doesn’t follow</li>
    <li>Your trip is prepaid and non-refundable</li>
    <li>You’re going somewhere medically remote or politically unstable</li>
    <li>You’re traveling during a volatile season (hurricanes, winter storms, etc.)</li>
    <li>You have known medical issues that could flare up</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When It’s Probably Not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheap domestic road trips</li>
    <li>Trips booked with refundable fares and hotel cancellation windows</li>
    <li>Your credit card already provides solid travel perks</li>
    <li>You’re okay taking the loss in a worst-case scenario</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Buy It Without Getting Screwed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare quotes on sites like Squaremouth or InsureMyTrip</li>
    <li>Don’t buy it from the airline or cruise line—shop independently</li>
    <li>Read the fine print (seriously)—know the exclusions and payout limits</li>
    <li>Look for medical evacuation coverage over $100k minimum</li>
    <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bottom line?</strong> Travel insurance isn’t a scam. But it’s not always necessary either. It’s a tool. Use it wisely, and it’ll pay off in peace of mind—not panic at the gate.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Don’t gamble with your trip—or your wallet.</strong><br>
