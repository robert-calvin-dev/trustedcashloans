  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why Your Bank Hates You</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 19, 2025</strong></p>
  
  <p>
  Your bank smiles in their ads. They say you’re “valued.” They call you a “customer.” But here’s the uncomfortable truth: **if you’re broke, your bank hates you** — and profits off your pain.
  </p>

  <h2>The Business Model Is Built to Punish You</h2>
  <p>
  Banks make the most money when you’re struggling:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>$35 overdraft fees</strong> for spending $1 too much</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum balance fees</strong> for not having enough money</li>
    <li><strong>ATM fees</strong> for using your own money outside their tiny network</li>
    <li><strong>Late fees, maintenance fees, hidden fees</strong>... all aimed at people who can least afford them</li>
  </ul>
  
  Meanwhile, wealthy account holders get interest, cashback, and concierge service. You? You get “insufficient funds.”
  </p>

  <h2>You’re Not a Customer. You’re a Target.</h2>
  <p>
  If you:
  <ul>
    <li>Live paycheck to paycheck</li>
    <li>Use debit for everyday purchases</li>
    <li>Occasionally overdraft or miss a due date</li>
  </ul>
  …you are not their ideal customer. You are a **profit center**. They don’t want you to succeed. They want you to hover in just enough debt to keep racking up fees — but not enough to leave.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Banks Don’t Want You to Leave</h2>
  <p>
  Because inertia is profitable. Switching banks feels hard, so they know most people won’t bother. Meanwhile:
  <ul>
    <li>They hold your money</li>
    <li>They earn interest off your deposits</li>
    <li>They sell your data</li>
  </ul>
  And if you overdraft? They’ll slap you with a fee, then charge you again **every day you’re negative.**
  </p>

  <h2>Modern Alternatives That Don’t Hate You</h2>
  
  <p>If you’re tired of traditional banks bleeding you dry, here are alternatives built for real humans:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chime</strong> – No fees, overdraft protection, early paycheck access</li>
    <li><strong>Current</strong> – Mobile-first, budgeting tools, no minimums</li>
    <li><strong>One Finance</strong> – Auto-savings, no overdraft fees</li>
    <li><strong>Cash App</strong> – Not technically a bank, but still safer than Wells Fargo for many</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These aren’t perfect. But they’re not playing the same rigged game either.</p>

  <h2>If You’re Stuck With a Traditional Bank</h2>
  <p>
  Here’s how to fight back:
  <ul>
    <li>Opt out of overdraft “protection” — it’s a trap</li>
    <li>Set up low-balance alerts and auto-transfers</li>
    <li>Use prepaid cards for daily expenses</li>
    <li>Call and ask for every fee to be waived — **yes, every single one**</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Word</h2>
  <p>
  You’re not imagining it. Your bank is not your friend. If you feel like you’re getting punished for being broke — it’s because you are.  
  But you can opt out of their game. And you should.  
  Your money deserves better — and so do you.
