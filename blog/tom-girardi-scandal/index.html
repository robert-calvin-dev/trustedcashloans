  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Tom Girardi Law Firm Finance Scandal</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>He was the lawyer who took down PG&E in the Erin Brockovich case. Tom Girardi had fame, influence, and a multimillion-dollar law firm. Behind the suits and settlements? A financial collapse built on deceit, lies, and stolen funds.</p>

  <h2>1. The Rise</h2>
  <p>Girardi Keese was once a legal powerhouse. They won huge settlements and represented high-profile clients. Girardi lived lavishly—private jets, luxury homes, political clout—but no one questioned where the money came from.</p>

  <h2>2. The Fall</h2>
  <p>In 2020, cracks began to show. Clients weren’t getting paid. Lawsuits piled up. Whispers of misused funds became roars. By 2021, the firm was bankrupt. Over $56 million in debts. Clients—including plane crash victims—were defrauded.</p>

  <h2>3. The Method</h2>
  <p>Girardi allegedly ran the firm like a Ponzi scheme—robbing Peter to pay Paul. Settlement funds meant for victims were diverted to maintain his personal lifestyle. It wasn’t mismanagement. It was theft.</p>

  <h2>4. The Aftermath</h2>
  <p>Dozens of lawsuits. Disbarment. A dementia diagnosis that many claim is convenient. Tom Girardi went from icon to infamous. Trust was shattered—especially in the legal world. Victims are still fighting for justice.</p>

  <h2>5. The Lessons</h2>
  <p>Even the powerful can be predators. Always verify—don’t just trust reputation. Read settlement terms. Ask where your money is. Get legal second opinions. Transparency isn’t optional when it’s your future on the line.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>When justice gets bought, everyone pays.</strong><br>
  If you've ever been burned financially or need help getting back on your feet, <a href="/" style="color: darkblue; text-decoration: underline;">apply for a personal installment loan</a> — with transparency and no hidden scams.
