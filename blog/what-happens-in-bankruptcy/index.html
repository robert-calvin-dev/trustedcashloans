  <h1 style="text-align: center;">What Happens in Bankruptcy?</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 19, 2025</strong></p>
  
  <p>
  Bankruptcy is often seen as a last resort — and for good reason. But it's also a legal tool that exists to help individuals overwhelmed by debt find relief and a way to rebuild. If you're wondering what bankruptcy actually means, how it affects your financial life, and what to expect if you file, this guide breaks it down.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What Is Bankruptcy?</h2>
  <p>
  Bankruptcy is a legal process that allows individuals or businesses to eliminate or repay debts under the protection of the federal bankruptcy court. It’s not just about wiping the slate clean — it’s about reorganizing your finances under court supervision.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Types of Bankruptcy for Individuals</h2>
  <p>
  There are two main types of bankruptcy used by individuals:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chapter 7:</strong> Also known as “liquidation,” this type involves selling non-exempt assets to pay off creditors. Most unsecured debts (like credit cards and medical bills) are discharged.</li>
    <li><strong>Chapter 13:</strong> This type lets you keep your property while repaying part of your debt over a 3- to 5-year plan. It’s ideal for people with regular income who want to avoid foreclosure or repossession.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>How Does Bankruptcy Affect Your Credit?</h2>
  <p>
  Bankruptcy will have a major impact on your credit score:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chapter 7</strong> stays on your credit report for up to 10 years.</li>
    <li><strong>Chapter 13</strong> remains for up to 7 years.</li>
  </ul>
  That doesn’t mean your financial future is ruined — but it does mean lenders will consider you high-risk for a while. That’s why rebuilding credit after bankruptcy is crucial.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What Debts Are Discharged in Bankruptcy?</h2>
  <p>
  Bankruptcy can discharge many types of unsecured debt, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Credit card balances</li>
    <li>Medical bills</li>
    <li>Personal loans</li>
    <li>Utility bills</li>
    <li>Most collection accounts</li>
  </ul>
  However, bankruptcy typically does <strong>not</strong> discharge:
  <ul>
    <li>Student loans (in most cases)</li>
    <li>Child support or alimony</li>
    <li>Recent taxes</li>
    <li>Fines and criminal penalties</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Will I Lose Everything?</h2>
  <p>
  Not necessarily. Each state has exemption laws that protect certain assets like:
  <ul>
    <li>Your primary residence (up to a certain equity limit)</li>
    <li>A personal vehicle</li>
    <li>Household goods and personal items</li>
    <li>Retirement accounts (usually exempt)</li>
  </ul>
  Most Chapter 7 cases are “no asset” cases, meaning you don’t have anything the court can take.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Can I Still Get a Loan After Bankruptcy?</h2>
  <p>
  Yes — but it will be harder and more expensive. Many borrowers start by:
  <ul>
    <li>Getting a secured credit card</li>
    <li>Taking out a credit-builder loan</li>
    <li>Using short-term options like <a href="/paydayloans/">payday loans</a> or <a href="/personalloans/">personal installment loans</a> for urgent expenses</li>
  </ul>
  Some lenders specialize in working with borrowers who have a bankruptcy on their record. Over time, with responsible repayment, you can rebuild your score and qualify for better financial products.
  </p>
  
  <h2>When to Consider Bankruptcy</h2>
  <p>
  Filing for bankruptcy is a serious decision. Consider it if:
  <ul>
    <li>You’re being sued or harassed by creditors</li>
    <li>You’re months behind on major bills</li>
    <li>You have more debt than you could repay in 5 years</li>
    <li>Debt collectors are garnishing your wages</li>
  </ul>
  Always consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney before filing.
  </p>
