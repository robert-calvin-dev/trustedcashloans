  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Generosity is a virtue—until it turns into a full-time job you’re not getting paid for. If you're always bailing people out, spotting cash, or picking up emotional slack, it’s time to check your boundaries.</p>

  <h2>1. Spot the Signs of Overgiving</h2>
  <p>Do you feel resentful after helping? Are you short on your own bills while someone else eats off your dime? That’s not kindness. That’s exploitation wearing a smile.</p>

  <h2>2. Know What You Owe (and Don’t)</h2>
  <p>You don’t owe anyone your rent money. You don’t owe a loan just because someone asked. Generosity without limits isn’t generosity—it’s enabling.</p>

  <h2>3. Practice Saying No Without a TED Talk</h2>
  <p>You don’t need a 5-minute speech. "I’m not able to help right now" is complete. Let the silence sit. The ones who guilt trip you? They were never on your team.</p>

  <h2>4. Set Hard Rules and Stick to Them</h2>
  <p>No loans over $50. No bailing out repeat offenders. No giving when it costs you your peace. Write them down. Enforce them.</p>

  <h2>5. Redirect Your Energy</h2>
  <p>Want to give back? Volunteer. Share resources. Uplift people without draining yourself. Healthy giving doesn’t bankrupt the giver.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Boundaries aren’t selfish—they’re necessary.</strong><br>
  If you’ve been giving away your future, it’s time to reclaim it. <a href="/" style="color: darkblue; text-decoration: underline;">Apply now for a personal installment loan</a> and make sure your generosity starts at home.
