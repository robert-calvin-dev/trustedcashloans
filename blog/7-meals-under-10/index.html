  <h1 style="text-align: center;">7 Meals for Under $10</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Being broke doesn’t mean being hungry—or worse, living off ramen and regret. These 7 meals prove you can eat well, feel full, and still keep it under ten bucks.</p>

  <h2>1. Chili Mac</h2>
  <p>Boxed mac and cheese + a can of chili = one hell of a comfort bowl. Top with shredded cheese if you’ve got it. Feeds 2–3 people for under $7.</p>

  <h2>2. Fried Rice Remix</h2>
  <p>Day-old rice, frozen veggies, soy sauce, and an egg or two. Optional: chopped hot dogs or canned chicken. Costs under $5, tastes like takeout.</p>

  <h2>3. Bodega-Style Egg Sandwiches</h2>
  <p>Eggs, cheese slices, and bread or buns. Throw in some hot sauce or bacon bits if you’re fancy. Makes 4 sandwiches for about $6.</p>

  <h2>4. Bean & Cheese Burritos</h2>
  <p>Flour tortillas, refried beans, shredded cheese, and a splash of hot sauce. Toast ‘em in a pan for crispy edges. $8 feeds 3 people.</p>

  <h2>5. Tuna Pasta Salad</h2>
  <p>Rotini pasta, canned tuna, mayo, and frozen peas. Chill it or eat warm. Stretch it over multiple meals—around $7 total.</p>

  <h2>6. Ramen Upgrade Bowl</h2>
  <p>Start with instant noodles. Add a soft-boiled egg, green onions, leftover veggies, and maybe a splash of soy or sriracha. Gourmet on $3.</p>

  <h2>7. Budget Stir Fry</h2>
  <p>Frozen stir-fry mix + soy sauce + instant rice + one protein (tofu, egg, or chicken). One pan, full belly, about $9 all in.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Broke doesn’t mean bland.</strong><br>
