  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Luigi Mangione and the U.S. Health Care System</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>What started as a viral meme became a symbol of everything wrong with the American health care system. Luigi Mangione, an Italian man stunned by a $70,000 hospital bill in the U.S., wasn’t just a punchline. He was a warning sign.</p>

  <h2>Welcome to the World's Most Expensive Sick Day</h2>
  <p>In most countries, getting care for a minor illness might cost you a cab ride and a co-pay. In the United States? It’s a game of roulette—with bankruptcy on the line. Luigi Mangione learned that firsthand after seeking emergency care during a visit to the States. One visit. One basic procedure. Five figures. Zero mercy.</p>

  <h2>Insurance That Doesn’t Insure</h2>
  <p>Even with so-called "coverage," the average American gets stuck paying thousands. Deductibles, co-insurance, networks, pre-approvals—it’s a maze built to confuse and deny. Luigi wasn’t prepared for that. Neither are most Americans until it’s too late.</p>

  <h2>The Broken Math of Medical Debt</h2>
  <p>60% of bankruptcies in the U.S. are tied to medical costs. That statistic should be national shame. Instead, it’s a business model. Patients become debtors. Hospitals act like collectors. And people suffer, all in the name of profit.</p>

  <h2>What Luigi’s Story Exposes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The absurdity of out-of-pocket costs for basic care</li>
    <li>The international embarrassment of billing practices</li>
    <li>The exploitation of tourists and uninsured patients</li>
    <li>The weaponization of paperwork and insurance loopholes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>So, What Can You Do?</h2>
  <p>If you live in the U.S., advocate for change. Vote with your voice, your wallet, and your representatives. If you’re visiting? Get comprehensive travel insurance <em>before</em> you land. If you’re broke and hurt? You’re not alone—and that’s the real tragedy.</p>

  <strong>Health care should heal—not bankrupt.</strong><br>
