  <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Theranos Investment Scam</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Theranos claimed it could run hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood. Investors threw billions at it. What they got instead was vaporware wrapped in lies, charm, and ambition.</p>

  <h2>The Dream</h2>
  <p>Founded by Stanford dropout Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos promised to revolutionize healthcare. Her idea? An affordable device that made blood testing fast, easy, and nearly painless. It was seductive—and it was science fiction.</p>

  <h2>Smoke and Mirrors</h2>
  <p>The tech didn’t work. But Holmes and her team faked demos, doctored results, and misled investors and patients. Lab employees were silenced with NDAs. Whistleblowers were threatened. The FDA and Wall Street were kept in the dark.</p>

  <h2>Big Names, Blind Spots</h2>
  <p>Theranos wasn’t lacking high-profile believers. Henry Kissinger, Rupert Murdoch, and former U.S. Secretaries of State sat on the board. Their clout lent Holmes credibility—without asking for proof.</p>

  <h2>The Unraveling</h2>
  <p>In 2015, a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> investigation exposed the fraud. The technology was fake. Patient risk was real. By 2018, Theranos shut down. Holmes and her COO, Sunny Balwani, faced federal charges. Holmes was convicted in 2022.</p>

  <h2>The Warning</h2>
  <p>Theranos showed how easily hype can blind even seasoned investors. It also reminded us: if the science isn’t peer-reviewed and the tech can’t be tested, walk away.</p>
