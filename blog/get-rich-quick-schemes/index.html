  <h1 style="text-align: center;">10 Biggest Get Rich Quick Scheme Flops of the 90’s</h1>
  <p><strong>Published by Trusted Cash Loans • May 29, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>The 90s were neon bright, full of dial-up tones—and ripe for scams. The “get rich quick” mentality exploded in the pre-dot-com boom, with wannabe moguls chasing shortcuts to wealth. Here's a cautionary countdown of ten unforgettable failures.</p>

  <h2>1. The Beanie Baby Bubble</h2>
  <p>People mortgaged homes to buy plush toys. Ty Inc. discontinued characters to create artificial scarcity—and then flooded the market. Today? Most are worth less than a Happy Meal toy.</p>

  <h2>2. Excel Communications</h2>
  <p>Excel sold long-distance service through a multi-level marketing (MLM) model. It was the golden child of telecom MLMs—until cell phones destroyed long-distance bills, and the company collapsed.</p>

  <h2>3. Sports Card Speculation</h2>
  <p>Collectors hoarded rookie cards expecting fortune. Overproduction and lack of rarity tanked the market. The result? Shoe boxes full of worthless cardboard.</p>

  <h2>4. 1-900 Phone Scams</h2>
  <p>Call a psychic! Get rich tips! Rack up a $300 phone bill! The FTC cracked down in the late 90s, but by then, millions had already been drained one minute at a time.</p>

  <h2>5. The Clinton Million Fax Club</h2>
  <p>This MLM promised payouts for sending fax-based offers. Like early spam. It made money—for the top 1%. The rest just paid for fax paper.</p>

  <h2>6. Psychic Hotline Investments</h2>
  <p>Dionne Warwick fronted the movement, but no one saw the collapse coming. Turns out, vague advice isn’t a solid investment strategy.</p>

  <h2>7. Amway Recruiting Blitz</h2>
  <p>While still active today, Amway's 90s heyday saw ultra-aggressive recruiting tactics. Many walked away with debt—not profits.</p>

  <h2>8. Chain Letter Gifting Circles</h2>
  <p>“Send $100 to the person at the top.” This pyramid-style “gifting” scheme preyed on trust and small-town hope. Most participants got nothing back.</p>

  <h2>9. Magazine Subscription Hustles</h2>
  <p>Earn cash reselling overpriced magazine subscriptions door-to-door! Except you didn’t. These were thinly veiled commission scams with little to no payout.</p>

  <h2>10. Internet Gold Rush Scams</h2>
  <p>With dot-com stocks booming, grifters sold “internet startup kits” or “domain flipping blueprints” with fake promises. When the bubble burst in 2000, so did the dreams.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>If it sounds too good to be true—it’s a 90s scam waiting to happen.</strong><br>
