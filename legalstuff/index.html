  <p>
  Welcome to Trusted Cash Loans. We believe in being upfront, honest, and crystal clear — especially when it comes to your privacy, data, and rights. This page covers the core legal disclosures that govern how our site works and how we treat your information.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Disclosures & Disclaimers</h2>
  
  <p><strong>We are not a lender.</strong> Trusted Cash Loans is a marketing and lead generation platform that connects users with third-party lenders and financial service providers. We do not issue loans directly, make credit decisions, or determine loan terms. All loan decisions are made by the lender you’re connected with.</p>
  
  <p><strong>APR & Loan Terms Vary.</strong> Actual interest rates, loan amounts, fees, and repayment schedules are set by the lenders in your state and may vary depending on your creditworthiness and state regulations.</p>
  
  <p><strong>No Guarantees.</strong> Filling out a form on our site does not guarantee loan approval. We do not guarantee offers, rates, or timelines. Your loan terms, if approved, will be disclosed directly by the lender before you agree to anything.</p>
  
  <h2>Compliance Notices</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fair Lending:</strong> We support equal access to credit and adhere to the principles of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).</li>
    <li><strong>State Regulations:</strong> Loan availability may vary by state. Some states do not permit payday lending. We do not operate in jurisdictions where such services are restricted or prohibited.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Privacy & Data Use</h2>
  
  <p>
  By using our site, you agree to our <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> and acknowledge that your submitted information may be shared with third-party lenders for the purpose of matching you with a loan offer. We do not sell your personal information to unrelated third parties.
