  <h1 style="text-align: center;">U.S. State Payday & Installment Loan Laws</h1>

  <p>
  Payday and personal loan regulations vary by state. At Trusted Cash Loans, we comply with all local lending laws and only connect borrowers to lenders authorized to operate in their jurisdiction. Below is a general overview of payday and installment loan legality across the United States.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Payday Loan Availability by State</h2>
  <p>
  <strong>States Where Payday Loans Are Legal:</strong><br>
  Alabama, Alaska, California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <strong>States with Strict Limitations or Bans:</strong><br>

  </p>
  
  <p>
  If you live in a state where payday lending is restricted, you may still qualify for a personal installment loan with longer repayment terms and more flexible underwriting standards.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Installment Loan Regulations</h2>
  <p>
  Installment loans are available in most states, though APR caps, maximum loan amounts, and licensing requirements vary by jurisdiction. Trusted Cash Loans only partners with lenders that follow applicable state and federal laws, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Truth in Lending Act (TILA)</li>
    <li>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</li>
    <li>Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</li>
    <li>State-specific rate and term restrictions</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>APR Caps & Disclosures</h2>
  <p>
  Some states impose interest rate caps on small-dollar loans. For example:
  <ul>
    <li>Colorado: 36% APR cap</li>
    <li>Connecticut: 12% APR cap</li>
    <li>New York & New Jersey: Payday loans are illegal regardless of APR</li>
  </ul>
  Our lending partners are required to disclose all APRs, repayment schedules, and total repayment amounts before you accept any offer.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Borrower Protections</h2>
  <p>
  All lenders in our network are required to:
  <ul>
    <li>Clearly display all loan terms prior to agreement</li>
    <li>Honor state-mandated cancellation periods (where applicable)</li>
    <li>Provide fair and non-deceptive practices under federal law</li>
    <li>Allow early repayment without penalty</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Using Loans Responsibly</h2>
  <p>
  State laws are designed to protect borrowers from debt cycles, excessive interest, and hidden fees. We strongly advise using short-term loans only for urgent, unavoidable expenses, and reviewing all terms carefully before accepting funds.
  </p>
