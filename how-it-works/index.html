  <h1 style="text-align: center;">How Trusted Cash Loans Works</h1>

  <p>
  Getting a loan shouldn’t be confusing, time-consuming, or full of red tape. At Trusted Cash Loans, we’ve built a fast, secure, and transparent process to help you connect with lenders that fit your financial situation — whether you need funds until payday or a longer-term installment option.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 1: Complete the Short Online Form</h2>
  <p>
  Start by filling out our secure loan request form. It takes under 2 minutes to complete. You'll provide basic personal and financial information such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, address, and contact details</li>
    <li>How much you’d like to borrow</li>
    <li>Your employment or income status</li>
    <li>Your banking details (to deposit funds, if approved)</li>
  </ul>
  No faxing. No long documents. Just clear questions and instant routing.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 2: Choose Your Loan Type</h2>
  <p>
  Based on your state and profile, you may qualify for:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Payday Loans</strong> – Short-term, high-urgency funds repaid by your next paycheck</li>
    <li><strong>Installment Loans</strong> – Larger loan amounts with monthly payments over time</li>
  </ul>
  We’ll guide you through the loan selection process and explain the key differences.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 3: Get Matched with a Lender</h2>
  <p>
  Once your application is submitted, we’ll instantly connect you with a network of approved lenders in your area. This process usually takes less than 30 seconds. Each lender sets their own rates, terms, and eligibility requirements.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 4: Review Terms & Accept the Offer</h2>
  <p>
  If a lender offers you a loan, you’ll be shown full loan details including:
  <ul>
    <li>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</li>
    <li>Repayment schedule</li>
    <li>Loan amount and total repayment cost</li>
    <li>Fees, if applicable</li>
  </ul>
  You are never required to accept an offer. There is no penalty for declining. If the terms don’t work for you, simply walk away.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 5: Receive Your Funds</h2>
  <p>
  If you agree to the terms and electronically sign the lender’s agreement, funds are typically deposited directly into your checking account by the next business day. Some lenders offer same-day funding depending on the time and method of approval.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Fast Facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>100% online process – no in-person visits</li>
    <li>Bad credit OK – multiple lenders accept low scores</li>
    <li>Funding as fast as same-day in many states</li>
    <li>No hidden fees – our service is always free to use</li>
  </ul>
