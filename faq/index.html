<h2>What is Trusted Cash Loans?</h2>
<p>
Trusted Cash Loans is an online loan connection platform that helps individuals find short-term payday loans and longer-term personal installment loans from a network of licensed U.S. lenders. We are not a direct lender and do not make credit decisions.
</p>

<h2>Do I qualify for a loan?</h2>
<p>
Eligibility varies by lender, but most borrowers must:
<ul>
  <li>Be at least 18 years old</li>
  <li>Have a steady source of income</li>
  <li>Have an active bank account</li>
  <li>Be a resident of a U.S. state where loans are legally permitted</li>
</ul>
Credit score is not the only factor — many lenders consider employment history and income stability.
</p>

<h2>Will applying affect my credit score?</h2>
<p>
No. Submitting a loan request through our site does not affect your credit score. Some lenders may perform a soft or hard credit pull if you accept their loan offer.
</p>

<h2>How much can I borrow?</h2>
<p>
Payday loans typically range from $100 to $1,000. Personal installment loans can range from $1,000 to $5,000. Final approval amounts depend on your income, state regulations, and the lender's policies.
</p>

<h2>How fast can I get the money?</h2>
<p>
Many lenders offer same-day or next-business-day funding once your application is approved and signed. Timing may vary depending on your bank’s deposit schedule.
</p>

<h2>What’s the difference between a payday loan and an installment loan?</h2>
<p>
A payday loan is a short-term loan repaid in full by your next payday (typically 7–31 days). An installment loan is repaid over time in regular monthly payments, usually over several months or years.
</p>

<h2>What are the interest rates?</h2>
<p>
APR varies by loan type, lender, and state law. Payday loan APRs may range from 124% to 700%. Installment loan APRs typically range from 6.99% to 149%. All rates will be disclosed by the lender before you agree to any loan.
</p>

<h2>Do you charge a fee to use this service?</h2>
<p>
No. Trusted Cash Loans is 100% free to use. You are never charged to submit an application or view loan offers.
</p>

<h2>Can I cancel a loan after applying?</h2>
<p>
Yes. If you change your mind, simply do not accept the lender's offer. If you've already signed a loan agreement, you must contact the lender directly. Some lenders offer a cancellation period or "rescission window."
</p>

<h2>What if I have bad credit?</h2>
<p>
Many of our lending partners accept applications from individuals with poor or limited credit. While approval is not guaranteed, we encourage you to apply — credit score is only one part of the decision.
</p>

<h2>Is my personal information safe?</h2>
<p>
Yes. We use advanced encryption and never sell your data. Your information is only shared with lenders who may provide you with a loan offer. For details, see our <a href="/privacypolicy/">Privacy Policy</a>.
