  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Personal Installment Loans – Flexible Funding on Your Terms</h1>

  <p>
  At Trusted Cash Loans, we help you connect with lenders who offer longer-term personal installment loans — a smarter, more manageable alternative to short-term payday loans. With repayment terms ranging from several months to a few years, these loans provide flexibility and breathing room when you need it most.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What Is a Personal Installment Loan?</h2>
  <p>
  A personal installment loan is a fixed-sum loan that is repaid over a set number of scheduled payments. Unlike payday loans, which are due in full on your next payday, installment loans allow you to repay gradually, typically over 6 to 72 months.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Common Uses for Installment Loans</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Debt consolidation</li>
    <li>Medical expenses</li>
    <li>Auto repairs or upgrades</li>
    <li>Unexpected bills or emergencies</li>
    <li>Major purchases or home improvements</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Loan Amounts & Terms</h2>
  <p>
  Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $5,000 depending on your creditworthiness and state laws. Repayment terms vary by lender but often range between 6 and 36 months, with monthly payments fixed for the life of the loan.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Who Is Eligible?</h2>
  <p>
  Most lenders in our network consider applications from individuals with:
  <ul>
    <li>Stable monthly income</li>
    <li>A checking or savings account</li>
    <li>A valid phone number and email address</li>
    <li>U.S. citizenship or permanent residency</li>
  </ul>
  You may still qualify even with a poor or limited credit history.
